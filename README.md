### Read a loveletter: http://kaerleksgenerator.com

Express.js is used to serve the website. To run it locally install node.js, clone the repository, go to root directory of the project in a command console and run:

`npm install`  
`npm start`

Now in a browser you get love at http://localhost:61116

The website is rendered from jade templates in ./views.

To change the synonyms used to build the loveletter edit ./lib/words.js

To use your own templates edit ./lib/loveletter.js.
